## Logic and Syntax exercises for beginners in Python 


### Environment: </br>
<b>SDK</b>: Python 3.8

### Starting: 

1. <b> Be located in the terminal in the /app folder </b> (use commands 'cd' and 'ls')

2. <b> Run "python -m paddocks" command </b>

3. <b> If u cant do this way after trying some time, right click on '__main__.py' and click 'Run __main__'  </b>

### Code and Recommendations:


1. <b> Read and understand the current code </b>
2. <b> Use paddocks.paddocks_exercises to code your methods </b>
3. <b> The data to work with 'paddocks_exercises' is in 'paddock_db' in the same folder </b>
4. <b> Use good practices for a code that is as clean as possible, no method can modify the original databases unless otherwise stated </b>
5. <b> I recommend you use gitflow </b> (Download this repository, upload in your own and commit after every single exercise is done) 
6. <b> Don't blame yourself if you have trouble solving, this is a real technical interview. If u burnout, go outside, breath fresh air and come again later</b>
7. <b> Remember, luck does not exist here, good luck</b>
